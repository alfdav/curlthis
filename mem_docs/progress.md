## What works

The application can take a raw HTTP request as input and convert it into a curl command. It supports reading input from a file, stdin, or the clipboard. It also supports copying the generated curl command to the clipboard.

## What's left to build

There is nothing left to build, as the application is already functional.

## Progress status

100% complete.
