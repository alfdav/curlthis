## What's left to build

The core application is complete and fully functional. Potential future enhancements could include:

- **Additional Output Formats**: Support for generating commands for other HTTP clients (wget, httpie, Postman collections)
- **Request Validation**: More robust validation and error handling for malformed requests
- **Advanced Curl Options**: Support for additional curl options like timeout, follow redirects, etc.
- **Configuration File**: Allow users to set default options via a configuration file
- **GUI Interface**: A simple graphical interface for users who prefer not to use the command line
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability
