# Active Context

## What you're working on now

I am currently working on maintaining the memory bank for the `curlthis` application. The application is fully functional and all memory bank files have been created and populated with relevant information.

## Recent changes

The most recent changes include:
- Completed the implementation of the `curlthis` application with all core functionality
- Created and populated all memory bank files with detailed information about the project
- Implemented the Pokemon Function Naming Convention throughout the codebase
- Added installation scripts for both Unix/Linux (install.sh) and Windows (install.ps1)
- Added uninstallation scripts for both platforms
- Added author headers to all files (2025-03-06 11:33)
- Created documentation styling guidelines (2025-03-06 11:40)

## Next steps

The project is complete and fully functional. Potential next steps could include:
- Adding support for more complex HTTP request formats
- Implementing additional output formats beyond curl (e.g., wget, httpie)
- Adding unit tests to ensure reliability
- Creating a web interface for the tool
