# Active Context

## What you're working on now

I am currently working on a deep dive to understand the `curlthis` application and create documentation inside the `mem_docs/` directory. This involves reading the source code, `README.md`, and creating the required memory bank files.

## Recent changes

The most recent change was the creation of the `productContext.md` file, which describes the purpose of the application, the problems it solves, and how it should work.

## Next steps

The next steps are to create the remaining memory bank files:

*   systemPatterns.md
*   techContext.md
*   progress.md
*   developmentGuidelines.md
