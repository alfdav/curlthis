# Active Context

## What you're working on now

I am currently working on standardizing the Typer CLI styling with Pokemon naming convention. This work involves creating templates, guides, and documentation to ensure consistent styling across all projects while maintaining the Pokemon Function Naming Convention.

## Recent changes

The most recent changes include:
- Completed the implementation of the `curlthis` application with all core functionality
- Created and populated all memory bank files with detailed information about the project
- Implemented the Pokemon Function Naming Convention throughout the codebase
- Added installation scripts for both Unix/Linux (install.sh) and Windows (install.ps1)
- Added uninstallation scripts for both platforms
- Added author headers to all files (2025-03-06 11:33)
- Created documentation styling guidelines (2025-03-06 11:40)
- Created an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Typer styling standardization (2025-03-06 12:07)
- Implemented a Typer template with Pokemon naming convention (2025-03-06 12:08)
- Created a Typer-specific styling guide (2025-03-06 12:09)
- Updated the Python Terminal Styling README to include Typer information (2025-03-06 12:09)
- Created an update to the terminal styling standards document to recommend Typer over Click (2025-03-06 12:14)
- Migrated the `curlthis` application from Click to Typer following the new styling standards (2025-03-06 12:22)
- Updated installation scripts to work correctly with Typer implementation (2025-03-06 12:29)
- Improved installation scripts to provide clearer instructions for using the application (2025-03-06 12:36)

## Next steps

The project is complete and fully functional. Potential next steps could include:
- Migrating the `curlthis` application from Click to Typer using the new standards
- Adding support for more complex HTTP request formats
- Implementing additional output formats beyond curl (e.g., wget, httpie)
- Adding unit tests to ensure reliability
- Creating a web interface for the tool
- Updating other projects to use the new Typer styling standards
